for any given data set the number of visual encodings—and thus the space of possible visualization designs—is extremely large

Time-series data—sets of values changing over time—is one of the most common forms of recorded data.

# Time-Series Data
Index Charts: raw values are less important than relative changes.
Stacked Graphs: a visual summation of time-series values
Small Multiples: can be constructed for just about any type of visualization: bar charts, pie charts, maps, etc. This often produces a more effective visualization than trying to coerce all the data into a single plot.
Horizon Graphs: a chart that preserves data resolution but uses only a quarter of the space

# Statistical Distributions
Histogram
stem-and-leaf plot: It typically bins numbers according to the first significant digit, and then stacks the values within each bin by the second significant digit.
Q-Q plot: compares two probability distributions by graphing their quantiles against each other.
SPLOM: enables visual inspection of correlations between any pair of variables.
Parallel Coordinates: plot the data on parallel axes and then connect the corresponding points with lines

# Maps
Flow Maps: depict the movement of a quantity in space and (implicitly) in time
Choropleth Maps:  a color encoding of the geographic area
Graduated Symbol Maps: places symbols over an underlying map
Cartograms: distorts the shape of geographic regions so that the area directly encodes a data variable

# Hierarchies
Node-link Diagrams: a tree diagram
Adjacency Diagrams: a space-filling variant of the node-link diagram; rather than drawing a link between parent and child in the hierarchy, nodes are drawn as solid areas (either arcs or bars), and their placement relative to adjacent nodes reveals their position in the hierarchy.
