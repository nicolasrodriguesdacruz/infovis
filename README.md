in 2010 alone we will generate 60 million times the content of the Library of Congress.

for any given data set the number of visual encodings—and thus the space of possible visualization designs—is extremely large

Time-series data—sets of values changing over time—is one of the most common forms of recorded data.

# Time-Series Data
Index Charts: raw values are less important than relative changes.
Stacked Graphs: a visual summation of time-series values
Small Multiples: can be constructed for just about any type of visualization: bar charts, pie charts, maps, etc. This often produces a more effective visualization than trying to coerce all the data into a single plot.
Horizon Graphs: a chart that preserves data resolution but uses only a quarter of the space

# Statistical Distributions
Histogram
stem-and-leaf plot: It typically bins numbers according to the first significant digit, and then stacks the values within each bin by the second significant digit.
 Q-Q plot: compares two probability distributions by graphing their quantiles against each other.
 SPLOM: enables visual inspection of correlations between any pair of variables.
